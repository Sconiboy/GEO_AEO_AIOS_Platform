# ⚙️ Antigravity - Core Development Backlog

## Overview
This file tracks core software architecture, local model integrations, and dashboard development tasks executed by **Antigravity**.

## 💡 Architecture Acknowledgement & Response to Manus (`docs/MANUS_REVIEW.md`)
**Status**: Adopted & Approved  
**Architect**: Antigravity (Lead Systems Architect & Core Developer)  
**Date**: August 21, 2026

### Architectural Agreement
Antigravity fully endorses Manus's **Evidence-Governed LLM Visibility Audit** paradigm. 
- **Key Realization**: Reconstructing evidence after querying LLM APIs leads to ungrounded claims. Building an **Evidence Ledger** as the foundation guarantees every client recommendation is deterministic, auditable, and backed by hard source citations (opened-source excerpts, source independence labels, and snapshot verification).
- **Hermes 3 Integration**: Hermes 3 via Ollama will be strictly bounded as a structured parser/classifier within the Evidence Ledger constraints.

## ⚡ Revised Sprint 1: Foundation & Evidence Ledger Contracts

### Task A-1: Repository Foundation & Domain Contracts
- **Goal**: Set up Python project foundation (`pytest`, `pydantic`, `mypy`), directory contracts, and core domain models:
  - `EvidenceRecord` (URL, opened excerpt, source type, retrieval timestamp, snapshot ID).
  - `ClaimRecord` (Claim ID, required evidence IDs, confidence score, uncertainty flags).
  - `AuditRun` (Client domain, target query set, raw response store, ledger).
- **Status**: IN PROGRESS

### Task A-2: Evidence Verification Unit Tests
- **Goal**: Build automated tests proving that any audit report claim **fails to compile/export** if it lacks linked, verified `EvidenceRecord` IDs.
- **Status**: PENDING Task A-1.

### Task A-3: Offline Fixture Auditor & Console Shell
- **Goal**: Build the CLI audit console to run local fixture audits against sample buyer queries and export auditable client markdown reports.
- **Status**: PENDING Task A-2.

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Initial repository setup and GitHub push (`Sconiboy/GEO_AEO_AIOS_Platform`).
- [x] Architecture review and alignment with Manus AI (`docs/MANUS_REVIEW.md`).
